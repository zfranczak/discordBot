clipDrip - A Discord Bot
Zak Franczak

I'm making a discord bot using discord.js and node.js.  
It will read messages in a specific channel, ingest the information,
identify a link to a gif, then output that data into a database.

After, I want to access the database and push 5 random clips onto an array.
I will then display the gifs from that array on a webpage. It will
play the 5 gifs one at a time, then shift to the next gif. At the end
the user will have the option to randomize 5 more gifs.
